Looking to level up the design of your interior at home or in the office? These are the top ID firms in Malaysia for interior design and architecture you can’t miss.

Read the BM or Chinese version here.

There will come a time in almost every homeowner’s journey where they ask themselves: “Do I need an interior designer?”

Now, there is no absolute nor right or wrong answer to this as it honestly depends on situations and other factors. Say, what sort of idea you already have in place, your timeline and availability, and just how you plan to go about it.

However, it also cannot be denied that engaging with an interior designer or an architect who is fully equipped with knowledge or experience can bring you one step closer to your dream home. An interior designer or architect can help you conceptualise and come up with ideas that suit your preferences and lifestyle, whether it’s minimalistic room decor ideas or a Scandinavian living room interior design.

Not only that, when you engage with an interior designer you gain access to not only their expertise but also their connection to retailers. Meaning there’s a higher chance of finding a particular design or product, and at a wider range of prices too.

There are many benefits to working with an interior designer – and we’ve teamed up with Atap.co – Malaysia’s leading platform for home renovation and improvement – to help you on this journey. Here are a few recommended and top interior design firms in Malaysia, along with some key information to know:

How much does it cost to hire an interior designer in Malaysia?
This is highly subjective as interior design work varies depending on style, square footage, and expertise. So, in easier words, the price varies according to the homeowners’ wants or needs.

Here’s a rough estimation of how much you should expect to pay when hiring an interior designer in Malaysia:

Types of property Price
Condominium RM50,000 to RM150,000
Terrace house RM80,000 to RM250,000
Semi-detached house RM100,000 to RM350,000
Bungalow RM200,000 to RM600,000
\*This is just a rough estimation. You should always contact the interior design companies and request for a quote.

What are the top three industries that employ interior designers?
A vast majority of clients are often:

Homeowners
Property developers
F&B owners.
However, that doesn’t mean you need to belong to any of these categories to get interior design services. The sky’s the limit – beautiful home interior and design should be relished and appreciated by all.

We wanted a house that is warm and homey but have a feeling of being in a 5 star hotel in it. We wanted simple & clean but at the same time having that touch of elegance and timeless classy. We wanted a house that is minimal but offers a great storage system. For a 600sqft with 1 bedroom, this could be a headache to achieve. WO Atelier gave us all of what we wanted and more. Warm and homey home that feels like a 5 star hotel, simplistic but timeless designed home that is modern and minimal. And we have plenty of storages too! We love the personal touch at every corners of the house. The design is superb, beyond our wildest imagination. But what impresses us more than just the design is the work and effort put into it. Due to logistic constraints, there were a lot that we couldn’t do ourselves that most of the time Wayne would kindly help us do and he delivered amazingly ( even though sometimes it’s out of his jobscopes to do them).
